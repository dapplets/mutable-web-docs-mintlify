title: "Universal LifeCycle in Mutable Web"
description: "In Mutable Web, every interaction with applications, mutations, and objects follows a consistent workflow, which can be broken down into the following key stages:"
---

* **LocalChange**: Initial change occurs locally (e.g., creating, editing).
* **Publish**: The change can be published either as a fork or an update.
* **Pull Request**: The user can propose changes to the original author through a pull request.

## Semantic Context[​](#semantic-context "Direct link to Semantic Context")

Mutable Web introduces a structure where each object, whether it's a mutation or a document, has its lifecycle that involves local edits and potential publication.

The process follows a common pattern for all applications, mutations, or objects:

```
LocalChange => Publish (as Fork, as Update) => Pull Request
```

## Key Stages of the Lifecycle[​](#key-stages-of-the-lifecycle "Direct link to Key Stages of the Lifecycle")

### 1. LocalChange[​](#1-localchange "Direct link to 1. LocalChange")

When a user interacts with an object, a local change is made. These changes are isolated to the user’s local environment until they decide to publish. Some important concepts during this stage:

* **Multiple Edits**: A user can make multiple edits locally before deciding to publish.
* **Fork**: If the object belongs to another author, the first step is to fork the original object.
* **Visibility**: Objects can have visibility set to `private`, `devel`, or `public`.

#### Visibility Modes[​](#visibility-modes "Direct link to Visibility Modes")

* **Private**: The object is only visible by ID and does not appear in search results or public lists.
* **Devel**: The object is visible only in developer mode, ensuring it’s available for development purposes but not fully public.
* **Public**: The object is fully visible and searchable by others.

### 2. Publish (as Fork or Update)[​](#2-publish-as-fork-or-update "Direct link to 2. Publish (as Fork or Update)")

Once local changes are complete, the user can publish the object. This stage may vary depending on the ownership and origin of the object:

* **Fork**: If the object originated from another author, the user must fork it. This ensures the original remains intact while the new version (fork) branches off.
* **Update**: If the user owns the original object, they can publish changes as an update, which creates a new version of the object without forking.

The Publish button is context-sensitive, meaning it will change its function depending on whether the object is a fork or an update.

* A checkbox labeled **“notify origin”** allows the user to notify the original author if desired.

#### Example of Forking[​](#example-of-forking "Direct link to Example of Forking")

* **Forking a Foreign Mutation**: The user forks another author’s mutation, makes changes, and publishes it under their name.
* **Forking Your Own Mutation**: The user can fork their mutation for branching out new versions (e.g., for testing versus production).

#### Creating a Mutation from Scratch[​](#creating-a-mutation-from-scratch "Direct link to Creating a Mutation from Scratch")

A user can create a new mutation without forking from an existing one. In this case, the mutation will start with a null ID and will generate an ID once published.

### 3. Pull Request[​](#3-pull-request "Direct link to 3. Pull Request")

When changes are made to objects that originated from other users, the Mutable Web system allows the creation of a Pull Request. Instead of being a separate operation, it is integrated into the Publish action.

* The user can notify the original author by selecting the **“notify origin”** checkbox during the publishing process. This serves as the modern equivalent of a pull request, allowing the original author to review and incorporate changes.

### Editing Your Own Mutation Without an Origin[​](#editing-your-own-mutation-without-an-origin "Direct link to Editing Your Own Mutation Without an Origin")

When editing a mutation with no origin (no fork from another mutation), the changes are treated as updates. There is no need to create a local copy, and the ID remains the same as the original.

### Editing a Mutation with an Origin (Foreign Author)[​](#editing-a-mutation-with-an-origin-foreign-author "Direct link to Editing a Mutation with an Origin (Foreign Author)")

If a mutation is based on another author’s work (forked mutation), changes are still local until published. However, the origin metadata is preserved, and a **Publish as Fork** operation is required to keep the forked history intact.

### Publishing a Fork[​](#publishing-a-fork "Direct link to Publishing a Fork")

When publishing a fork, Mutable Web ensures that the original mutation is not altered. The new fork has its own unique ID and can be edited, published, and even forked by others in turn.

### Fork and Edit Lifecycle[​](#fork-and-edit-lifecycle "Direct link to Fork and Edit Lifecycle")

Each mutation can follow a different path depending on its origin:

1. *Forking Someone Else’s Mutation*:

2. *Forking Your Own Mutation*:

3. *Creating a Mutation from Scratch*:

4. *Editing Your Own Mutation (No Origin)*:

5. *Editing Your Own Mutation (With Origin)*:

By following these workflows, Mutable Web maintains a streamlined process for creating, editing, and managing mutations, ensuring both flexibility and control for developers and users alike.
