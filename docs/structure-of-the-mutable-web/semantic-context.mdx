description: "The  introduces a decentralized model where users have control over how websites function and appear in their browser. At the core of this system is the semantic context, where the concept of ownership shifts from a centralized entity to a community-driven structure."

In the traditional web, the website owner controls key aspects like data, design, and policies. In contrast, the **Mutable Web** allows users to modify, fork, and propose changes to the original website through Mutationsâ€”small units of functionality that alter the behavior of a site.

* **Welcome Mutation**: This is the default mutation for a new site upon first visit.
* **Favorite Mutation**: Users can set any current mutation as their favorite for a specific site.
* **Recent Mutations**: The most recent mutations are sorted by usage, with the latest ones appearing at the top of the list.
* **Current Mutation**: This is the active mutation applied to the site, determined based on user preferences or past interactions.

Mutations are managed in a way that ensures seamless interaction across pages, tabs, and users, allowing for versioning, tagging, and easy updates.
